### Hi there, I'm Arya. 

Iâ€™m Arya Lohia, a student studying Engineering and Robotics at Carnegie Mellon University.

My interests lie in the intersections of many fields, including Math, Science, Computer Science, Art, and more. I love business and management, and have managed several projects/teams, including [Daedalus Robotics](https://github.com/Daedalus-Robotics)â€“which has won both first and second prize at the national competition (in successive years).
Iâ€™m always ready to jump into learning something new, and am comfortable learning on the job.

I have completed several internships and projects, including at [DroneBlocks](https://droneblocks.io/?srsltid=AfmBOoqoDPsTc2tDeZzhPUyq87-n2WMh_tJRnVPchNp3-vQH170K6WlM) (building and testing education drone prototypes) and [Parsa Research Lab](https://mason.gmu.edu/~mparsa/) at George Mason University working on image processing algorithms.

I have experience working on several hardware and software-involved projects and have experience with the following languages:
