### Hi there, I'm Arya. 

Iâ€™m Arya Lohia, a current senior at [Ideaventions Academy](https://www.ideaventionsacademy.org/) in Reston, Virginia.

My interests lie in the intersections of many fields, including Math, Science, Computer Science, Art, and more. I am interested in management, and have managed several projects/teams, including [Daedalus Robotics](https://github.com/Daedalus-Robotics)â€“which has won both first and second prize at the national competition (in successive years)â€“and a school store.
Iâ€™m always ready to jump into learning something new, and am comfortable learning on the job.

I have also been interning at the [Parsa Research Lab](https://mason.gmu.edu/~mparsa/) at George Mason University working on image processing algorithms.

Worked with before:
- Python (NumPy, PyTorch, Jupyter, Flask)
- Java
- Flutter/Dart

Currently Learning:
- C/C++
- ROS/ÂµROS
- Vue3

Interested In:
- Machine Learning for CV and robotics applications
- Manim
