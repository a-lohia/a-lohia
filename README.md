### Hi there, I'm Arya. I love building stuff.

I’m Arya Lohia, Engineering and Robotics undergrad at Carnegie Mellon University.

My interests lie in the intersections of many fields, including Math, Science, Computer Science, Art, and more. I have experience with larger-scale projects, and have managed several projects/teams, including [Daedalus Robotics](https://daedalusavr.weebly.com)–which has won both first and second prize at the national competition (in successive years), as well as serving as Perceptions lead for [Carnegie Mellon Racing Autonomous Division](https://www.carnegiemellonracing.org).

I’m always ready to jump into learning something new, and am comfortable learning on the job.

I have completed several internships and projects, including at [Raft](https://teamraft.com) building and itegrating a small autonomous rover in a GPS-denied enivronment, [DroneBlocks](https://droneblocks.io/?srsltid=AfmBOoqoDPsTc2tDeZzhPUyq87-n2WMh_tJRnVPchNp3-vQH170K6WlM) building and testing education drone prototypes, and [Parsa Research Lab](https://mason.gmu.edu/~mparsa/) at George Mason University working on image processing algorithms.

I have experience working on several hardware and software-involved projects and have experience with the following languages/frameworks:
